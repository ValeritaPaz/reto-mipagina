        <p class="aboutParr">Pigs are often mislabeled as being greedy, dirty, and smelly animals by people, but what you never hear about is their incredibly loving and caring personalities, and the host of amazing and adorable things which they love to do. Pigs are actually exceptionally intelligent clean creatures who never make a mess where they sleep.</p>
        <p class="aboutParr">Unfortunately, many pigs are unable to show off their natural instincts and behaviors as they are forced to live confined in cramped and unclean factory farms.  To see some of these activities for yourself, take a visit to a farm animal sanctuary where you’ll be sure to catch a glimpse of pigs enjoying life to the max.</p>

        <p class="cardParr">Just like cats and dogs, pigs love to find a quiet spot to sprawl out on the floor with the sun on their back. One thing they have to be careful of, however, is that they don’t get sunburn in the intense summer heat, as their skin is very similar to a humans and is susceptible to burning.</p>

        <h4 class="card">Get Belly Rubs</h4>
        <p class="cardParr">Find the right spot on a pigs belly and he’ll drop to the ground and roll onto his side for a belly rub. Some pigs like this more than others, and the ones who are particularly fond of getting a good belly rub have been known to drop to the ground expectantly at the feet of their companions, waiting for the rub to begin!</p>

        <h4 class="card">Mud Bath</h4>
        <p class="cardParr">One of the ways in which pigs like to cool off is to take a mud bath. They find a shallow muddy wallow and roll around in it until they are caked in mud, and then they trot off to find a suitable place to sunbathe once more.</p>
